## 🏗️ Overview

The SafeGuard database implements a **visit-centric visitor management system** for gated communities and residential buildings. The core philosophy is that **visits (not individual visitors) receive QR codes**, and multiple visitors can be associated with a single visit.

### Key Concepts
- **Buildings** have 250 licenses by default (for registered users, not visitors)
- **Users** can create unlimited visitors per month
- **Visits** are the primary entity that gets QR codes
- **Visitors** are reusable profiles stored per building
- **QR codes** contain visit information and are generated by business logic after visit creation

---

## 🏛️ Architecture

### Database Design Principles
1. **Visit-Centric**: Everything revolves around visits, not individual visitors
2. **Reusable Profiles**: Visitor profiles can be reused across multiple visits
3. **License Management**: Only registered users count against building licenses
4. **Security-First**: Comprehensive audit trails and multi-level access control
5. **Performance-Optimized**: Strategic indexing and materialized views
6. **Schema Separation**: Logical organization with dedicated schemas for different domains
7. **Profile Management**: Extended user profiles with approval workflows

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 12+
- **Extensions**: uuid-ossp, postgis (optional for location features)
- **Features**: Row Level Security, Triggers, Materialized Views, Custom Types
- **Schema Organization**: Multi-schema architecture for better maintainability

### Schema Organization (Planned v2.0)

### 2. Users (`users`)
**Purpose**: Registered users in the system (residents, admins, security)

```sql
Key Fields:
- id (UUID, PK): Unique user identifier
- building_id (UUID, FK): Reference to building
- email (VARCHAR, UNIQUE): Login email

```

**Business Rules**:
- One visitor profile per phone number per building
- Profiles are reusable across multiple visits
- Automatically marked as frequent if visit_count >= 5

### 4. Visits (`visits`) 🎯 **CORE TABLE**

## 🔗 Relationships

### Primary Relationships
```
buildings (1) ← (M) users
buildings (1) ← (M) visitors
buildings (1) ← (M) visits
users (1) ← (M) visits (as host)
users (1) ← (M) visitors (as creator)
visits (M) ← (M) visitors (via visit_visitors)
users (1) ← (M) frequent_visitors
```

### Key Foreign Key Constraints
- All major tables reference `buildings` for data isolation
- `visits.host_id` → `users.id` (who's hosting)
- `visitors.created_by` → `users.id` (who registered the visitor)
- `visit_visitors` creates M:M between visits and visitors

```

### Query Optimization
- **Composite indexes** for common filter combinations
- **Partial indexes** for filtered queries (e.g., unread notifications)
- **JSON indexes** for metadata searches (if needed)

### Materialized Views
- `daily_visit_stats`: Pre-computed daily aggregates
- Refreshed by `daily_maintenance()` function
- Enables fast dashboard loading

### Connection Recommendations
- **Connection pooling** (PgBouncer recommended)
- **Read replicas** for analytics queries
- **Partitioning** for high-volume tables (future consideration)

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Creating a Visit with Multiple Visitors
```sql
-- Host creates a group visit
SELECT * FROM create_visit_with_visitors(
    'building-uuid-here',
    'host-user-uuid',
    'Birthday Party',
    'Family birthday celebration for Sarah',
    '2024-01-20 15:00:00+01',
    '2024-01-20 22:00:00+01',
    '[
        {
            "name": "John Doe", 
            "phone": "+2348123456789", 
            "email": "john@example.com"
        },
        {
            "name": "Jane Smith", 
            "phone": "+2348987654321", 
            "email": "jane@example.com"
        },
        {
            "name": "Bob Wilson", 
            "phone": "+2348555666777"
        }
    ]'::jsonb,
    'group'
);

-- Returns QR code that covers all 3 visitors
```

### Gate Processing Workflow
```sql
-- 1. Security scans QR code
SELECT * FROM process_qr_scan('SG_ABC123DEF456', 'Gate A', security_officer_uuid);

-- Returns visit info + all expected visitors:
-- {
--   "visit_data": {
--     "visit_id": "...",
--     "title": "Birthday Party",
--     "host_name": "John Resident",
--     "apartment_number": "A101"
--   },
--   "visitors": [
--     {"name": "John Doe", "status": "expected"},
--     {"name": "Jane Smith", "status": "expected"}, 
--     {"name": "Bob Wilson", "status": "expected"}
--   ]
-- }

-- 2. Individual visitors arrive and enter
SELECT * FROM update_visit_visitor_status(
    visit_uuid, 
    john_visitor_uuid, 
    'arrived', 
    security_officer_uuid
);

SELECT * FROM update_visit_visitor_status(
    visit_uuid, 
    john_visitor_uuid, 
    'entered', 
    security_officer_uuid
);

-- 3. Visitors leave individually
SELECT * FROM update_visit_visitor_status(
    visit_uuid, 
    john_visitor_uuid, 
    'exited', 
    security_officer_uuid
);

-- 4. Visit auto-completes when all visitors exit
```

### Adding to Frequent Visitors
```sql
-- After a successful visit, host can save visitor to favorites
SELECT add_to_frequent_visitors(
    host_user_uuid,
    visitor_uuid,
    'My Brother John',
    'family',
    1  -- highest priority
);

-- Next time, host can quickly invite from favorites list
SELECT * FROM get_visitor_recommendations(host_user_uuid, 10);
```

### Visitor Ban Management Examples 🚫

#### Creating and Managing Bans
```sql
-- Create a visitor ban (would be done via API, shown for reference)
INSERT INTO visitor_bans (building_id, user_id, name, phone, reason, severity, ban_type, notes)
VALUES (
    'building-uuid',
    'user-uuid', 
    'John Problem Visitor',
    '+2348123456789',
    'Inappropriate behavior during last visit',
    'medium',
    'manual',
    'Resident requested permanent ban due to security concerns'
);

-- Check if visitor is banned by specific user
SELECT is_visitor_banned_by_user('user-uuid', '+2348123456789');

-- Check if visitor is banned anywhere in building
SELECT is_visitor_banned_in_building('building-uuid', '+2348123456789');

-- Create temporary ban with expiry
INSERT INTO visitor_bans (building_id, user_id, name, phone, reason, severity, expires_at)
VALUES (
    'building-uuid',
    'user-uuid',
    'Jane Temp Ban',
    '+2348987654321', 
    'Noise complaints from neighbors',
    'low',
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '7 days'
);

-- Manually unban a visitor
UPDATE visitor_bans 
SET is_active = false,
    unbanned_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    unban_reason = 'Issue resolved, apology accepted',
    unbanned_by = 'unbanning-user-uuid'
WHERE phone = '+2348123456789' 
AND user_id = 'banning-user-uuid'
AND is_active = true;
```

#### Ban Analytics and Monitoring
```sql
-- Get building ban statistics
SELECT * FROM building_ban_stats WHERE building_id = ?;

-- Get user's ban activity
SELECT * FROM user_ban_stats WHERE user_id = ?;

-- Monitor ban trends
SELECT 
    DATE(banned_at) as ban_date,
    COUNT(*) as bans_created,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE severity = 'high') as high_severity,
    COUNT(DISTINCT phone) as unique_visitors_banned
FROM visitor_bans 
WHERE building_id = ? 
AND banned_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(banned_at)
ORDER BY ban_date DESC;

-- Find visitors banned by multiple residents
SELECT 
    phone,
    name,
    COUNT(*) as ban_count,
    ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT u.apartment_number) as banned_by_apartments,
    MAX(vb.severity) as highest_severity
FROM visitor_bans vb
JOIN users u ON vb.user_id = u.id
WHERE vb.building_id = ? AND vb.is_active = true
GROUP BY phone, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY ban_count DESC;
```

#### Automated Ban Management
```sql
-- Run automatic ban expiry (for scheduled jobs)
SELECT expire_visitor_bans();

-- Check for expiring bans (within next 24 hours)
SELECT 
    name,
    phone,
    expires_at,
    CONCAT(u.first_name, ' ', u.last_name) as banned_by
FROM visitor_bans vb
JOIN users u ON vb.user_id = u.id
WHERE vb.is_active = true
AND vb.expires_at IS NOT NULL
AND vb.expires_at <= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY expires_at;
```

## 🗄️ Database Reset and Constraint Management

### Database Reset Process

When you need to completely reset the SafeGuard database (for development or troubleshooting), follow this comprehensive process that handles foreign key constraints and triggers properly.

#### Understanding the Challenge

The SafeGuard database has complex relationships with:
- **48 foreign key constraints** maintaining data integrity
- **Audit triggers** that log all changes to critical tables
- **Analytical triggers** collecting real-time metrics
- **Business logic triggers** managing license counts and visit completion

Simply deleting data can cause **foreign key constraint violations** because:
1. Audit triggers try to log deletions while referencing being-deleted records
2. CASCADE operations may not reach all dependent records
3. Trigger execution order can create circular dependencies

#### The Force Reset Solution

The database reset process uses a **multi-step approach** to safely clear all data:

```sql
-- 1. DROP ALL TRIGGERS
-- Remove all triggers to prevent constraint violations during deletion
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public';

-- Drop each trigger:
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name ON table_name CASCADE;

-- 2. DISABLE FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
-- Temporarily disable constraint checking
SET session_replication_role = replica;

-- 3. TRUNCATE WITH CASCADE
-- Force clear all data ignoring foreign keys
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- 4. RE-ENABLE CONSTRAINTS
-- Restore normal constraint checking
SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;

-- 5. RECREATE ESSENTIAL TRIGGERS
-- Restore only the critical audit trigger with safety checks
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_audit_log() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    user_id UUID;
    building_id UUID;
    visit_id UUID;
    action TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Only create audit log if user exists
    IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
        user_id := OLD.user_id;
        building_id := OLD.building_id;
        visit_id := OLD.visit_id;
        action := 'DELETE';
        
        -- Check if user exists before creating audit log
        IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = user_id) THEN
            INSERT INTO audit_logs (user_id, building_id, visit_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, old_values)
            VALUES (user_id, building_id, visit_id, action, TG_TABLE_NAME, OLD.id, row_to_json(OLD));
        END IF;
        
        RETURN OLD;
    END IF;
    
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Current Database State After Reset

After a successful force reset, the database has:

✅ **Foreign Key Constraints**: **48 active constraints** maintaining data integrity
```sql
-- Major constraint relationships:
users.building_id → buildings.id
visits.host_id → users.id
visitors.created_by → users.id
visit_visitors.visit_id → visits.id
visitor_bans.user_id → users.id
audit_logs.user_id → users.id
-- ... and 42 more
```

✅ **Clean Tables**: All data tables have **0 records**
- 0 users (including super admins)
- 0 buildings
- 0 visitors, visits, licenses
- 0 audit logs, notifications

❌ **No Active Triggers**: **0 triggers** currently attached (prevents constraint conflicts)
- Triggers are NOT automatically recreated
- Only the `create_audit_log()` function exists
- This is intentional to prevent future constraint issues

✅ **Available Trigger Functions**: **16 trigger functions** ready for use
- `create_audit_log()` - Safe audit logging
- License management functions
- Analytics collection functions
- Timestamp update functions

### Constraint Management Best Practices

#### 1. **Understanding CASCADE Behavior**
```sql
-- CASCADE operations propagate through foreign key relationships
DELETE FROM buildings CASCADE;
-- This would delete:
-- - All users in the building
-- - All visits hosted by those users  
-- - All visitors created by those users
-- - All related audit logs, notifications, etc.
```

#### 2. **Safe Constraint Disabling**
```sql
-- Temporary constraint disabling (use with extreme caution)
SET session_replication_role = replica;  -- Disables triggers and FKs
-- Perform bulk operations
SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;  -- Re-enables constraints
```

#### 3. **Checking Constraint Status**
```sql
-- List all foreign key constraints
SELECT 
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY tc.table_name;
```

#### 4. **Monitoring Constraint Violations**
Look for these common error patterns:
```sql
-- Foreign key constraint violation
ERROR: insert or update on table "table_name" violates foreign key constraint
Detail: Key (column_name)=(value) is not present in table "referenced_table"

-- Circular dependency in CASCADE
ERROR: cannot delete from table because other objects depend on it
Detail: constraint xyz on table abc depends on table def
```

### Trigger Management

#### Current Trigger State
After database reset:
- **All triggers removed** to prevent constraint conflicts
- **Trigger functions preserved** and ready for reattachment
- **create_audit_log()** function enhanced with safety checks

#### Trigger Recreation Strategy
You can selectively recreate triggers based on your needs:

```sql
-- 1. Critical Audit Triggers (recommended)
CREATE TRIGGER tr_users_audit
    BEFORE DELETE ON users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION create_audit_log();

-- 2. License Management (for production)
CREATE TRIGGER tr_user_license_count
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_building_license_count();

-- 3. Analytics Collection (optional)
CREATE TRIGGER tr_visits_analytics
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON visits
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION create_analytics_event();
```

#### Trigger Safety Patterns
All new triggers should follow this safety pattern:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION safe_trigger_function() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Always check if referenced records exist
    IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
        -- Verify parent records exist before logging
        IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM parent_table WHERE id = OLD.parent_id) THEN
            -- Safe to proceed with trigger logic
            INSERT INTO audit_logs (...);
        END IF;
        RETURN OLD;
    END IF;
    
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Database Recovery Procedures

#### Full System Recovery
```sql
-- 1. Database reset (clears all data)
-- Run force reset script

-- 2. Initial system setup
POST /api/admin/initial-setup
{
  "email": "superadmin@metroplex.com",
  "password": "SuperSecure2024!",
  "firstName": "Sarah",
  "lastName": "Johnson",
  "buildingData": {
    "name": "Metroplex Towers",
    "address": "123 Business District",
    "city": "Lagos"
  }
}

-- 3. Verify system state
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;      -- Should be 1 (super admin)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM buildings;  -- Should be 1 (initial building)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM licenses;   -- Should be 1 (building license)
```

#### Partial Recovery (Development)
```sql
-- Clear specific data while preserving structure
DELETE FROM visit_logs;
DELETE FROM notifications;
DELETE FROM visits;
DELETE FROM visitors;
-- Keep users and buildings for testing
```

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Production Warnings**:
- Never disable constraints in production without proper backup
- Always test recovery procedures in development first
- Monitor constraint violations in application logs

✅ **Development Benefits**:
- Clean slate for testing new features
- Consistent database state across team members
- Easy troubleshooting of schema issues

💡 **Next Steps After Reset**:
1. Use `/api/admin/initial-setup` to create first super admin and building
2. Test with updated Postman collections using new test data
3. Recreate any custom triggers needed for development
4. Verify all foreign key relationships are working correctly

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For New Developers

1. **Understand the Core Flow**:
   ```
   User creates visit → QR generated → Visitors scan QR → Individual tracking → Visit completion
   ```

2. **Key Tables to Focus On**:
   - `visits` (core entity)
   - `visitors` (reusable profiles)
   - `visit_visitors` (many-to-many relationship)

3. **Essential Functions**:
   - `create_visit_with_visitors()` - Visit creation
   - `process_qr_scan()` - Gate operations
   - `update_visit_visitor_status()` - Visitor tracking

4. **Common Queries**:
   - Use views for dashboard data
   - Use functions for business logic
   - Check RLS policies for data access

### Migration from Old System
If migrating from a visitor-centric system:
1. Export existing visitor data
2. Group visitors by time/host into visits
3. Generate visit records with associated visitors
4. Preserve visitor history and ratings

**File**: `migrations/006_add_entry_exit_columns.sql`  
**Status**: ✅ Completed Successfully

#### Summary
Implemented Version 2 QR code scanning functionality that tracks building entry and exit separately, providing granular visitor access control and enhanced security monitoring.

#### Changes Made
1. **Added Columns to `visits` Table**:
   - `entry (BOOLEAN)`: Tracks if visitor has scanned QR code at building entry (DEFAULT: FALSE)
   - `exit (BOOLEAN)`: Tracks if visitor has scanned QR code at building exit (DEFAULT: FALSE)

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - `idx_visits_entry` index for entry status queries
   - `idx_visits_exit` index for exit status queries
   - `idx_visits_entry_exit` composite index for entry/exit status combinations

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM process_qr_entry_exit_scan(
       p_qr_code TEXT,
       p_scan_type VARCHAR(10), -- 'entry' or 'exit'
       p_security_officer UUID,
       p_gate_number VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT NULL,
       p_location POINT DEFAULT NULL
   );
   ```

4. **Business Logic Enhancements**:
   - **Entry Scanning**: Sets `entry = TRUE`, updates visit status to 'active'
   - **Exit Scanning**: Sets `exit = TRUE`, updates visit status to 'completed'
   - **Validation**: Cannot exit without entry scan first
   - **Prevents Duplicate Scans**: Checks existing entry/exit status
   - **Real-time Notifications**: Sends appropriate notifications for entry/exit

#### Impact

- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of visitor movement through building access points
- **Compliance**: Meets security requirements for visitor access monitoring

#### API Integration
- **New Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/visitors/scan/entry` - Scan QR for building entry (security only)
  - `POST /api/visitors/scan/exit` - Scan QR for building exit (security only)
- **Role-Based Access**: Only users with 'security' role can scan QR codes
- **Enhanced Middleware**: New `requireSecurityOnly` middleware for strict role enforcement

#### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Before Migration
visits table: 28 columns (id through updated_at)

-- After Migration  
visits table: 30 columns (added entry, exit)
- entry (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)
- exit (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)
- 3 new indexes for performance optimization
```

#### Security Enhancements
1. **Strict Role Enforcement**: Only security personnel can scan QR codes
2. **Sequential Validation**: Must scan entry before exit
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot scan same QR multiple times for same action
4. **Complete Audit Trail**: All scans logged with timestamp, officer, and location

#### Migration Execution Details
- **Execution Date**: 2025-01-14
- **Execution Time**: < 1 second (schema changes only)
- **Rollback Available**: Column drop procedures available
- **Data Loss**: None (all operations are additive)
- **Existing Data**: All existing visits default to entry=false, exit=false

#### Supporting Features
This migration enables:
- Separate entry/exit gate scanning
- Enhanced visitor flow tracking
- Security checkpoint management
- Building access compliance
- Real-time visitor location awareness within building
- Advanced analytics on visitor entry/exit patterns

#### Function Details
The new `process_qr_entry_exit_scan()` function provides:
- **Validation**: QR code format and expiry checking
- **Status Management**: Automatic visit status transitions
- **Logging**: Comprehensive action logging with security officer details
- **Notifications**: Real-time alerts to hosts about visitor entry/exit
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for invalid operations

#### Usage Example
```sql
-- Entry scan
SELECT * FROM process_qr_entry_exit_scan(
    'SG_ABC123DEF456', 
    'entry', 
    '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
    'Main Gate',
    POINT(-6.5244, 3.3792)
);

-- Exit scan  
SELECT * FROM process_qr_entry_exit_scan(
    'SG_ABC123DEF456',
    'exit',
    '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 
    'Main Gate',
    POINT(-6.5244, 3.3792)
);
```

This migration represents a significant enhancement to the SafeGuard system's access control capabilities, providing building administrators and security personnel with granular control over visitor movement tracking.
